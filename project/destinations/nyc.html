financial capital of the world. </p>

<p> Many districts and landmarks in New York City have become well known, and the city received a

<a target="_blank" href="../images/new-york-times-square.jpg" title="Times Square">
<img src="../images/new-york-times-square.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="Times Square"></a>


<p> Formerly Longacre Square, Times Square was named in 1904 after the New York Times tower. The
newspaper first posted current headlines along its famous moving sign, the world's first, in 1928.
Long the heart of the Theater District, Times Square fell into decay during the Depression when many
theaters shut down. The city cleaned up the area by inviting corporations such as Disney to move into
the area. Today, Times Square has become a much safer place, day and night, with shopping, theaters
and restaurants galore, not to mention its mammoth billboards. </p> </div>

<div class="tour"> <li><h2>Tour B: Statue Of Liberty </h2></li>

<a target="_blank" href="../images/new-york-city-statue-of-liberty.jpg" title="Statue of Liberty">
<img src="../images/new-york-city-statue-of-liberty.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="Statue of Liberty"></a>

<p> The Statue of Liberty was France's gift to America. It was built in 1886 and remains a famous
world symbol of freedom and one of the greatest American icons. It is the world's largest statue and
stands just less than 152 feet tall from the base to the torch, and weighs approximately 450,000 pounds.
The statue offers a fine view of the New York Harbor and lower Manhattan. It is located on Liberty Island
and a short boat ride is required to get to the statue. To see the statue from shore, Battery Park sits
on the southern tip of Manhattan and affords great views of New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty.
From here visitors can catch the ferry to the statue and Ellis Island. </p> </div></ul>

<p> <b> Rating:</b> 5/5 </p>

<p> An absolute assault on the senses, but you just have to go here if you are in New York! It is a
real mecca, and is<br> surrounded by great bars and restaurants, but you can just sit and watch life go
by at a multitude of paces whilst<br> taking in the view. Stay as long or as short as you want, it does
not matter. You will feel amazed!</p></div>

<p> Possibly the worst place I have ever been. The place is filthy, smelly and certainly not a good
advert for what is good about America. Constantly accosted by 'Superheroes' or painted ladies wanting
to charge you for photographs. Be nice if they could take no for an answer. It's not a tourist zone,
it's an extortion zone. </p></div>

<p> This is a must-do if you're in NYC! A short ferry ride takes you from Battery Park to Lady Liberty.
Amazing photo ops of the NY skyline and the Statue on the ride over. Make sure you purchase entry to the
museum and/or crown before your visit. So much history! A definite must-do on any visit to the Big Apple!</p></div>

<p> Whilst we didn't go inside the statue the island itself was a nice afternoon out. The ferry (though a
little busy and expensive) was a fun way to travel to the island and a walk around the statue was relaxing
and educational. It also offered a great view of the city skyline. </p></div>

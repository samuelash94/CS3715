<div class="desc"><p> Barbados is a sovereign island country in the Lesser Antilles. It is 34 kilometres
(21 mi) in length and up to 23 kilometres (14 mi) in width, covering an area of 432 square
kilometres (167 sq mi). It is situated in the western area of the North Atlantic and 100
kilometres (62 mi) east of the Windward Islands and the Caribbean Sea; therein, it is about
168 kilometres (104 mi) east of the islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and 400
kilometres (250 mi) north-east of Trinidad and Tobago. Barbados is outside of the principal
Atlantic hurricane belt. </p>

<p> In 1966, Barbados became an independent state and Commonwealth realm with the British
Monarch (presently Queen Elizabeth II) as hereditary head of state. It has a population of
277,821 people, mostly of African descent. Despite being classified as an Atlantic island,
Barbados is considered to be a part of the Caribbean, where it is ranked as a leading tourist
destination.</p></div>

<a target="_blank" href="../images/barbados-crane-beach.jpg" title="Crane Beach">
<img src="../images/barbados-crane-beach.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="Crane Beach"></a>

<p> Crane Beach, with its beautiful pink coral sand, was once a boat landing where cargo was
unloaded and lifted by a crane perched atop the cliff. Today it's one of the most famous
beaches in Barbados. Cruise ship visitors, tourists, and locals alike come here to frolic in
the rolling surf, sunbathe on the soft sands, and peek at the luxury Crane Beach Hotel, the
oldest hotel in Barbados. Public access to the beach requires a descent down many stairs,
while the hotel has its own elevator to sand level. </p></div>

<div class="tour"><li><h2>Tour B: Harrison's Cave </h2></li>

<a target="_blank" href="../images/barbados-harrisons-cave.jpg" title="Harrison's Cave">
<img src="../images/barbados-harrisons-cave.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="Harrison's Cave"></a>

<p> Harrison's Cave, a crystallized limestone cavern, features streams, waterfalls, cascades,
and deep pools. After an educational film, visitors tour a one-and-a-half-kilometer route
via electric tram with a stop to walk to a waterfall plunging to a deep pool below. Lights
illuminate the impressive stalactites, stalagmites, and cascading waters. Near the cave, a
visitor's center displays Arawak Indian artifacts. </p></div></ul>

<p> Harrison's Cave was extremely beautiful and showcased the beauty and development of the
island. The tour was very<br>informative and the cave was naturally beautiful and serene. There
is also beautifully landscaped forestry etc that you<br> can walk through and see flowers trees
and plants. If you like nature and natural formations you would love Harrison's<br> Cave. A must see</p></div>

<p> Definitely worth the visit, Harrison's cave is steeped in history and wonder. A gorgeous
natural wonder, you cannot miss this if you visit Barbados. It's also good if you have limited
mobility as you go down in a little cart they call a tram.</p></div>

<p> We were just here in June and the seaweed was under control. We stayed at the resort but
went to investigate the public access. If you are not staying at the resort: the public
access could be treacherous. I don't kno why anyone would pick tour b, the beach is worth it!</p></div>

<div class="response"><p><em>Jill J, we're glad you enjoyed the beach! However, Tour B is also well worth it.

<p> My husband and I were able to walk the length of this beach one morning and we had the
entire beach to ourselves. The white sand was beautiful although marred by the presence of
the sea weed (However, the seaweed is seasonal) </p></div>

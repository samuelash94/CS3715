Barcelona is the capital city of the autonomous community of Catalonia in Spain and Spain's
second most populated city, with a population of 1.6 million within its administrative
limits. It is the largest metropolis on the
Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besos,
and bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range, the tallest peak of which
is 512 metres (1,680 ft) high.</p>

<p>Barcelona, the cosmopolitan capital of Spain's Catalonia region, is defined by quirky art
and architecture, imaginative food and vibrant street life. It has medieval roots, seen in
the maze like Gothic Quarter, but a modernist personality represented by architect Antoni
Gaudi's fantastical Sagrada Familia church. Its restaurant scene, anchored by the central
Boqueria market, ranges from fine dining to tiny tapas bars.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="../images/sagrada1.jpg" title="La Sagrada Familia">
<img src="../images/sagrada1.jpg" alt="La Sagrada Familia"></a>

<p>La Sagrada Familia is the most popular attractions in Barcelona, attracting nearly 2.8
million visitors each year. It is a large and intricate basilica designed by Antoni Gaudi.
Construction began in 1882 and continues to this day. The building is predicted to be
completed within the next 30 years. Visitors will be captivated by the design elements and
the religious symbolism built into all the spaces of the church. A glorious exterior and
interior make La Sagrada Familia truly unmissable.</p> </div>

<div class="tour"><li><h2>Tour B: Tour of/FC Barcelona Match at Camp Nou</h2></li>

<a target="_blank" href="../images/barca6.jpg" title="Camp Nou">
<img src="../images/barca6.jpg" width="600" height="350" alt="Camp Nou"></a>

<p>One for the sports fans, yet still one of Barcelona’s most popular attractions. This
stadium is home to formidable European football champions F.C. Barcelona. With a capacity
of 99,000 people, this breathtaking sporting arena is Europe’s largest. A tour of the
ground is definitely worthwhile and you never know, you might be lucky enough to catch a
game!</p> </div></ul>

<font size = "2"><p>by TooTallFinn24, Written Jun 10, 2012 </p></font>

<p> <b> Rating:</b> 3/5 </p>

<p>There are many places where buying advance tickets to see a place or take part in an
event is essential in Spain.<br> My experience with La Sagrada Familia was this was not
necessary based on how quick the line moves. We arrived<br> at La Sagrada Familia on a late
April Sunday afternoon at just past noon. There was a long line that ran around two<br> blocks.
It looked daunting. However in fifteen minutes we were on our way inside.</p>

<p> The cost of purchasing tickets at great escapes is just a little over 3 euros per
person more than purchasing them<br> directly at the ticket booth. For an adult admission was
11 euros while from escapes it was 14.30. While purchasing<br> a ticket in advance does give
you a specific time waiting in line shouldn't take that much time and will help save you<br>
some coins</p></div>

<p>Barcelona deserves more of my time - My trip here was far too short and consequently I
missed a great deal, but a good excuse for another trip in the future. I will continue to
check the progress of the GREAT BUILDING = Sagradia Familia hopefully in person if not -
Well on VT of course  </p></div>

<p> hi we were in Barcelona a few weeks ago and wanted to get football tickets, the official
web site of FC Barcelona didnt work or had no seats together 5 people ... so after checking
a few sites we found this site, they dont have a variety of tickets, but we got all 5 tickets
together just behind the goal and they charged less than most other sites ... the tickets
got to the hotel with a surprise! a Barca scarf ... any way it was a dream come true!!!
Also, it can be cold, but we got the scarf!!!</p></div>

<p>What a club! I was so lucky to see them in 2009. They were playing picture perfect
football.</p>

<p><ol>
<li> Purchase tour A. You don't want to miss Sagrada do you??
<li> Buy tickets over the phone after you arrive. Camp Nou holds 98,000 so only the
BIGGEST matches sell out.</li>
<li> They don't sell beer in Camp Nou. I guess I should have known this.</li>
<li> Camp Nou is pretty far from the main city so leave kind of early, but there is very
little in the way of entertainment<br> out there, think Comiskey Park not Wrigley Field.</li>
<li> BTW, did I mention, they don't sell beer in Camp Nou!?!?</li></ol></p></div>
